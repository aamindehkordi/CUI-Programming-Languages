# KMeans - InClass

This directory contains a Python script related to the K-Means clustering algorithm. The main contents of the directory are as follows:

## Python Script

1. **K-MeansClustering.py:** This script implements the K-Means clustering algorithm. It includes several functions that perform different parts of the algorithm, such as calculating Euclidean distances, finding the closest centroid, initializing empty clusters, assigning items to the closest cluster, choosing random centroids, calculating centroid locations, updating centroids, plotting clusters in 2D, and creating K-Means clusters. The script also includes a dictionary of student grades, which seems to be the data that the K-Means clustering algorithm is applied to.
