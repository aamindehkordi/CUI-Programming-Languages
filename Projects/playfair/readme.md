## Python Script

1. **Playfair.py:** This script implements the Playfair cipher. It includes several functions such as removing duplicates, creating a Playfair grid, pairing up characters, decoding Playfair digrams, and encrypting and decrypting using the Playfair method. The script prompts the user to enter a secure alpha-non-numeric key and a message to be encrypted. It then prints the encrypted message, starts the decryption process, and finally prints the decrypted message.
