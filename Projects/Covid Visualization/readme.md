# Covid Visualization

This directory contains Python scripts and other files related to COVID-19 data visualization. The main contents of the directory are as follows:

## Python Scripts

1. **CovidVisualization.py:** This script imports several libraries such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib to handle and visualize COVID-19 data. It reads data from an online source and a local text file, filters and processes the data, and finally creates a plot to visualize the data.

2. **covid_deaths_state_size.py:** This script contains data related to COVID-19 deaths and population densities for various states in the United States. It includes three lists: 'states', 'densities', and 'deaths'. The 'states' list contains the names of the states, the 'densities' list contains the population densities for each state, and the 'deaths' list contains the number of COVID-19 deaths for each state.

## Other Files

1. **2020_Fall_AliAmin_BigDataPlots.ipynb:** This Jupyter notebook likely contains code related to COVID-19 data visualization.

2. **california_county_stats.txt:** This text file likely contains data used in the Python scripts.

3. **california.png:** This image file likely contains a visual output from the Python scripts.
