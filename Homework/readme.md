# Homework

The Homework directory contains several Python scripts that were likely used for homework assignments in a programming course. Here is a brief description of each script:

- `MonteCarloPi.py`: This script uses the Monte Carlo method to estimate the value of Pi. It generates a certain number of random points within a square and then calculates the proportion of those points that fall within a circle inscribed within the square. This proportion approximates the ratio of the areas of the circle and the square, which is used to estimate the value of Pi. The script also uses the turtle module to visually represent the process.

- `QDecoder.py`: This script appears to be designed to decode a specific type of encoded text. The script contains a function named `decode_playfair_digrams` that takes an encoded text as input. The function searches for the letter 'Q' in the text and checks if the characters before and after 'Q' are the same. If they are, it removes the 'Q' and the preceding character. The function continues this process until there are no more 'Q's in the text. The script then returns the decoded text.

- `draw_polygon.py`: This script uses the turtle module to draw polygons. The script contains a function named `drawPolygon` that takes a turtle, a side length, and a number of sides as inputs and uses the turtle to draw a polygon with the specified attributes. The script then uses this function to draw several polygons with different side lengths and numbers of sides.

- `homework17.py`: This script appears to be designed to manipulate images. The script contains two main functions: `scale_image` and `enlarge_image`. The `scale_image` function takes an image and a scale factor as inputs and returns a new image that is the original image scaled by the scale factor. The `enlarge_image` function takes a filename as input, reads the image from the file, scales the image, and then displays both the original and scaled images. There is also a `reduce_size` function that appears to reduce the size of an image by a given scale factor.
